# bbplot

This repository encompasses Python implementations for conducting residual analysis, a pivotal component in predictive modeling. Analyzing residuals—the deviations between predicted and observed values—facilitates a deeper understanding of a forecasting model's behavior. The included package, **bbplot**, comprises three distinct functions tailored for this analysis:

1. **bijan.resid**: This function generates a plot of residuals across their range, providing insights into the mean and standard deviation of residuals, their half-width, and the associated p-value, thereby offering a comprehensive overview of residual behavior.

2. **bijan.pval**: It calculates and returns the p-value for the model's prediction errors, offering a statistical measure to assess the significance of the residuals.

3. **bijan.eplot**: Designed to furnish a multifaceted view of residuals, this function produces a composite plot consisting of four subplots: a residual plot, a histogram of errors, a Q-Q plot for assessing normality, and an autocorrelation plot to examine dependency among residuals.

Through the temporal examination of residual value, analysts can discern patterns within forecast errors, thereby evaluating the model's predictive accuracy. The distribution plot is instrumental in verifying the assumption of normality in residuals, while the autocorrelation plot is crucial for detecting dependencies among residuals, both of which are essential for refining forecasting models.
